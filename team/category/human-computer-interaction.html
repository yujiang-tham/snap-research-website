    <h3 class="team--nav-h3 container">üî¨RESEARCH</h3>
    <p class="container">
      We invent and study technologies that enable people to connect and collaborate in new ways. We do this by building prototypes, launching experimental products, and studying how people use them to guide future technology investments. We publish and share our insights with the broader research community in venues like CHI, CSCW, UbiComp, and UIST. 
    </p>
    <p class="container">
      Our keywords: <i>social computing, ubiquitous computing, augmented reality, wearables</i>
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="team--nav-h3 container">üéíINTERNSHIPS</h3>
    <p class="container">
      We are recruiting interns for <b>spring, summer, and fall</b> of 2022. Our research focuses on understanding and/or building playful social systems that can empower how we express ourselves and interact with each other.
    </p>
    <p class="container">
      We primarily hire PhDs students with a strong track record of publications in HCI venues, but we also hire a handful of undergraduate and master‚Äôs students with research experience and strong engineering and/or design skills. Our research interns get to work with a variety of technologies (e.g. AR, IoT, biosignals) and devices (e.g., smartglasses, watches). The internship projects have led to publications at top-tier conferences (e.g., CHI, CSCW, UbiComp), new experimental products, and integration with existing ones.
    </p>
    <p class="container">
      All interested students should <a href="https://snap.submittable.com/submit">apply online</a>. Applications should include a CV and a research statement articulating how your prior work/skills align with our research initiatives and the internship's ideal outcome.
    </p>

    <h3 class="team--nav-h3 container">About Us</h3>
    <p class="container">
      We invent and study technologies that enable people to connect and collaborate in new ways. We do this by building prototypes, launching experimental products, and studying how people use them to guide future technology investments. We publish and share our insights with the broader research community in venues like CHI, CSCW, UbiComp, and UIST.
    </p><br>
    <p class="container"> We currently focus on developing technologies that support social presence, both in-person and
      remote, through the following three research initiatives: </p><br>
    <p class="container"> 1. <b>AR Communication.</b> How can communication be experienced more deeply using smart glasses and AR?
    </p><br>
    <p class="container"> 2. <b>Authentic connections.</b> How can authentic and emotional interactions between people, leveraging
      sensed data? </p><br>
    <p class="container"> 3. <b>Co-located AR.</b> How can we design playful technologies that foster in-person interactions rather
      than distract us away from the people around us? </p><br>
    <p class="container"> We take interns year-round, but most of them join in the summer. Internships typically last three
      months. We tend to hire PhDs students with a strong track record of publications in HCI venues. Applications usually
      include a research statement that articulates how the applicant's prior work and skills align with our research
      initiatives and the internship's ideal outcome. </p>
